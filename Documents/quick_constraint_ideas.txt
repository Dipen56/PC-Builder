[EASY - Constraints related to Motherboard Size]

1)	Graphics Cards
- Check that you can link 1..4 graphics card onto a motherboard.
- Also check that all these graphics cards are exactly the same (same name and model)
- If ATX Sized motherboard --> 1..4
- If microATX sized --> 1..2
- else just 1.
2) Ram Modules
- Check that you can link 1..4 RAM modules onto a motherboard.
- Check that they are the same type (i.e. DDR3).
- You DON'T have to check that they are the same capacity (i.e. 1x 8GB and 1x 16GB)
- If ATX Sized motherboard --> 1..4
- else --> 1..2
3) Storage Drives.
- Check that you can link 1..6 storage drives onto a motherboard.
- You DON'T have to check that they are the same capacity (i.e. 1x 8GB and 1x 16GB)
- If ATX Sized motherboard --> 1..6
- If microATX Sized motherboard --> 1..3
- else --> 1..2

[Medium]
1) CPU
- Check that the chipset of the CPU matches the chipset of the motherboard.
	- Reject the CPU if it doesn't match the motherboard chipset.
	- TODO: this can be fixed by adding a SocketType Field in the CPU and Motherboard Concepts.

[More Difficult]
1) Ensure that the sum of components wattage is >= power supply wattage.
	- Reject the parts if the total wattage goes over the supply.
	- TODO: this can be fixed by adding a Wattage field in each component concept.
